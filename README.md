### To load games you need to put them in the /public/games folder by the following folder structure:

```
/games
-/gba
---(gba-games).7z
-/n64
---(n64-games).7z
-/nds
---(nds-games).7z
-/nes
---(nes-games).7z
-/snes
---(snes-games).7z
-/dos
---(dos-games).jsdos
```

The archive names must be **snake-case** the dashes represent spaces in the UI

### Sometimes the browser freezes and crashes due to the early nature of WebAssembly which is used in the emulator
